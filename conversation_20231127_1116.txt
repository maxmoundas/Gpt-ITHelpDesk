Assistant's response: Here’s the action plan:

1. From the 'Initial' state, the indicated solution is to 'Power On' the device. So, please go ahead and switch on your device.
2. Watch for the lights on your device; they should flash in sequence, indicating that it's in the 'PoweringOn' state.
3. While in the 'PoweringOn' state, it will automatically perform 'PowerSupplyCheck' and 'HardwareCheck' in sequence. Each check is timed transition and will take respective times, 5 and 10 seconds each.
4. Once all these checks are performed successfully, we need to move to the next state, 'SelfTest'. For that, we require 'Power On Complete' action from your side once all lights stop flashing.
5. In the 'SelfTest' state, the device will run a few self-tests. As soon as the tests are complete, we need to perform the action 'Tests Complete'.
6. After tests are complete, the system enters the 'Registration' state. In this state, you need to register the modem. This may require admin access, and the action is 'Register Modem'.
7. Once the modem is successfully registered, it will be in the 'Desired' state.

These steps should lead to a stable Internet connection. Keep an eye on the 'Desired' state's actions and respective sub-states for further instructions like WiFi or firewall actions. Please let me know after each step is completed so we can progress further.
*******************************************************
User's response: Okay, let's walk through this step by step to get your Internet connection stable.

1. **Initial State: Blinking Red Light** 
    - Action: The first step is to turn on the power. So, please go ahead and press the 'Power On' button. The modem will transition to 'PoweringOn' state. Let me know when the lights start flashing in sequence.

2. **State: Powering On - Flashing Lights In Sequence** 
    - Action: Once the modem has been powered on, it will automatically start checking the power supply and the hardware. This may take some time, about 5 seconds for power supply check and 10 seconds for hardware check. Please wait patiently and inform me once the self-tests have started.

3. **State: SelfTest - Performing Self-tests** 
    - Action: Now that the self-tests have started, let's wait for them to complete. Once done, the modem will transition to the 'Registration' state. Please inform me when this happens.

4. **State: Registration - Solid Green Light** 
    - Action: This state means that you need to register your modem. Normally, this task requires admin privileges; so, make sure you are allowed to do this before proceeding. Once the modem is registered, you will reach the 'Desired' state which means a stable Internet connection. Please let me know once you see a solid green light on your modem.

While we are at 'Desired' state, we can perform additional activities if you want. One of them is related to WiFi module and the other one is related to the Firewall module.

5. **State: Desired - Solid Green Light**
   - Action('rollover'): WiFi Module
        - It affects the WiFi connection. You can disable/enable the WiFi according to your needs and cycle through 'WiFiDisabled' and 'WiFiEnabled' states.
        
   - Action('rollover'): Firewall Module
        - It affects the network security. You can enable/disable the firewall according to your needs and cycle through 'FirewallEnabled' and 'FirewallDisabled' states.

Let's aim for the 'Desired' state first and then proceed with optional configurations. Please let me know of your progress every step of the way. If you face any issues in between, do not hesitate to inform me. We can troubleshoot together!
*******************************************************
Assistant's response: The user replied: The lights were flashing, but now I see a steady green light, and it seems like the modem is performing self-tests now.

Great! The modem is progressing as expected. Since the modem is now in the 'SelfTest' state, it is currently checking everything to make sure it can operate correctly. This is a good sign. 

Now, once the self-tests are complete, the modem will transition into the 'Registration' state. This will be indicated by a solid green light on your modem. It may take some time for the modem to finish its tests, so please wait for it to finish. 

Once the modem reaches the 'Registration' state, you will have to register your modem. This can often require administrative privileges, so please ensure you have the necessary permissions. 

When the modem is registered, it will reach the 'Desired' state, which means you will have a stable Internet connection. Please let me know if you reach this point. 

Please provide an update when you have done this or if anything changes.
*******************************************************
User's response: The user replied: The self-tests are done and the modem now shows a solid green light. Now, how can I register the modem?

Fantastic, you're doing great! Now we're getting onto the 'Registration' state.

Let's walk through the registration process:

1. Open the browser on your computer and type in the IP address for your modem's configuration page. This address should be stated in your modem's manual. 

2. Once you've entered the correct IP address, press 'Enter'. This should bring you to the login page of your modem's configuration software.

3. You'll be prompted to enter your admin username and password. If you've not set these up, they will likely be the factory default, which is often 'admin' for both the username and password.

4. Once logged in, look for an option that says 'Register Modem' or something similar. The layout and specific wording may vary depending on the model of your modem. It is usually found under 'Settings' or 'Advanced settings'.

5. After clicking on 'Register Modem', you'll likely be asked for your Internet Service Provider (ISP) account details. Enter these in the required fields.

6. Once complete, click 'Register' or 'Save' or whatever button will finalize your changes.

After you've completed these steps, your modem should be registered and you should be in the 'Desired' state with a stable internet connection. 

Again, the layout might vary depending upon your modem’s user interface, so please do not hesitate to ask if you need further assistance. I'm here to help. Please let me know once you've completed these steps, or if you encounter any issues.
*******************************************************
Assistant's response: The user's response is: The user replied: I've followed the steps you mentioned and I've registered the modem. The light is solid green. I guess we have reached the 'Desired' state, right? 

Yes, that's correct! If the light on your modem is solid green and you've successfully registered your modem, then congratulations! We've reached our 'Desired' state, which is the stable internet connection. I'm glad we were able to sort through that together.

Now, while we are in the 'Desired' state, you can also configure additional settings such as WiFi and Firewall according to your preference:

- **WiFi**: You may enable or disable it as per your needs. If you enable WiFi, the state will become 'WiFiEnabled'. If you disable WiFi, the state will become 'WiFiDisabled'. 

- **Firewall**: This plays a vital role in your network security. You can turn it on or off based on your choice. If you enable Firewall, the state will become 'FirewallEnabled'. If you disable Firewall, the state will become 'FirewallDisabled'.

Please let me know if you wish to adjust these settings or need assistance with anything else.
