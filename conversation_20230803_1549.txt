Assistant's response: Sure, I'd be happy to guide you through the process. Here are the steps you need to follow:

1. Our current state is "Initial", which is characterized by a blinking red light. Assuming that your modem is currently in "Initial" state, your first action should be to power it on. Once you've done that, let me know so we can proceed to the next step.

2. After you powered on the modem, it will enter the "PoweringOn" state, where you'll notice the lights flashing in sequence. This could take a few minutes, so please be patient. Once the "Power On Complete" action takes place, we'll then move to the "Registration" phase. Please inform me when you observe the power-on sequence has stopped.

3. In the "Registration" state, the modem light will be solid green. At this stage, we have to register the modem. Easy way to do it is to unplug the modem from the power source for a few minutes, then plug it back in. It should then automatically go through the registration process.

4. Finally, after registering the modem, it will enter the "Desired" state, depicted by a solid green light and a stable internet connection!

Please perform the first step and inform me when that is complete so we can move on to the next stage.
User's response: Okay, it appears that currently, your modem is in the 'Initial' state displaying a blinking red light, and you have no internet connection. To fix this, let's follow the steps given by the state machine.

1. The first action you need to take is to power on your modem. This will move us to the next 'PoweringOn' state. Please let me know once you've done this.
Assistant's response: Since I've powered on the modem, the lights are flashing in a sequence. What should I do next?
User's response: As an IT Help Desk, your next steps should be: Okay, that's great. Now it seems like your modem has entered the 'PoweringOn' state. The next step is to wait until the power on process is complete. Once the lights stop flashing and you see a solid green light, that means your modem has moved to the 'Registration' state. I am here, let me know once your modem gets to that state. Please remember that at this stage your internet connection may still not be working until we finish all the steps.
Assistant's response: As an IT Help Desk, I'm glad that the state has now changed to 'PoweringOn'. To proceed, you should wait until the 'Power On Complete' process takes place. You'll know this has occurred when the lights stop flashing sequentially and show a solid green light. This will mean that your modem has transitioned to the 'Registration' state. Once you notice this change, please let me know. In this state, your internet connection might still not be stable. But don't worry, we will progressively work through the steps to get to our 'Desired' state, where the internet connection will be stable.
User's response: You are the Help Desk, The user's response is : It looks like the lights have stopped flashing and there's now a solid green light. I think we've moved to the 'Registration' state. Should we proceed?. What is the suggested action now?
Assistant's response: You are the Help Desk, The user's response is : Excellent! Now that we have a solid green light and are in the 'Registration' state, the next step is to register the modem. In terms of actions, you need to do the following : 'Register Modem'. This action should take us to the action 'Desired' where we expect to have a stable internet connection. Please let me know once this has been completed. The current state is Registration. The suggested actions are [{'name': 'Register Modem', 'nextState': 'Desired'}].
User's response: You are the Help Desk, The user's response is : I have completed the modem registration and now, my internet seems to be working fine. I can see a solid green light, so I believe we are in the 'Desired' state now. Thank you for your help. What should I do if this happens again?. The current state is Desired. The suggested actions are [{'name': 'Reset Modem', 'nextState': 'Initial'}, {'name': 'Power Off', 'nextState': 'PoweringOff'}].
