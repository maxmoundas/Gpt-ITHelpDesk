Assistant's response: Based on the state machine provided, here is the step-by-step plan that we should follow:

1. From the 'Initial' state, you need to perform the 'Power On' operation. This will move the modem to the 'PoweringOn' state, which means you will see flashing lights in sequence.

2. Once the modem is powered on, and shows flashing lights in sequence, which means the modem is in the 'PoweringOn' state, you need to wait for 'Power On Complete'. This will then move the modem to 'Registration' state.

3. In 'Registration' state, the modem should show a solid green light to indicate a good connection but still, we don't have internet access. To fix this, the action 'Register Modem' needs to be performed which will lead us to the 'Desired' state for a stable Internet connection.

4. Please let me know once the modem shows a solid green light, which indicates that we are in the 'Desired' state after the modem has been registered. In this state, you should have a stable Internet connection.

If there are any issues with these steps, or you see different indicators than those illustrated in these steps, please get back to me with the observed modem behavior. We can then follow up with alternate troubleshooting steps.

User's response: From your current state, "Initial" (which indicates a blinking red light and no Internet connection), the first step is to "Power On" the device. Take a look at your modem and turn it on if it isn't already. This should change the state of your modem to "PoweringOn", which is indicated by flashing lights in sequence. Please let me know once you see the flashing lights.

Next, we will need to wait for the "Power On" process to complete. Once the power-on process is complete, your modem state should change to "Registration". In this state, you should see a solid green light on your modem. If you see this, please inform me right away.

During the "Registration" state, we need to "Register Modem". Generally, this process is automatic, but may require technical steps like entering ISP provided details. Please let me know once you see the solid green light, which demonstrates that your modem is registered.

After the modem is registered, it should change to the "Desired" state, which is our final goal. In the "Desired" state, there should be a stable Internet connection and a solid green light in your modem's indicators. 

This is our ultimate objective, once you observe a solid green light and can confirm the Internet is functioning properly, please let me know. If you face any issues or the device light indicators do not match the expected conditions at any step, please tell me immediately so I can modify the troubleshooting approach. 

Let's work on this together to get your Internet connection up and running quickly. Please begin with the first step and keep me updated on the progress.
Assistant's response: Great, now that your modem is 'PoweringOn', please monitor it until the device finishes its start-up process. Once the lights stop flashing in sequence and the solid green light is showing instead, your modem will have entered the 'Registration' state. At this point, it might require you to enter the ISP details to 'Register Modem'. After successful registration, it should shift to our desired state. Kindly update me once you see the solid green light which signifies that the modem has entered the 'Registration' state.

Assistant's response: The user's response is: Alright, as of now, you are still in the 'PoweringOn' stage - waiting for the modem to complete its power up process. Now, you should be looking for the lights to stop flashing in sequence and instead see a solid green light. This indicates that you've entered into the 'Registration' state.

During the 'Registration' state, the system may prompt you to 'Register Modem' by entering your ISP details. Once the registration is successful, the modem should transition into our objective, the 'Desired' state.

Please update me once you see the solid green light, meaning the modem is at the 'Registration' state. Remember, when you do finally reach the 'Desired' state, please say, "I have reached the Desired state."

Let's keep moving forward. Thank you for your cooperation. The current state is PoweringOn. The suggested actions are [{'name': 'Power On Complete', 'nextState': 'Registration'}].
*******************************************************
Assistant's response: Great, your modem has now reached the 'Registration' state signified by a solid green light. The next step is to register your modem, which may require inputting details provided by your ISP. 

Once you have successfully registered your modem, it should transition to the 'Desired' state. This will also be reflected by a solid green light and your internet connection should be stable. 

Remember to inform me by saying "I have reached the Desired state" once you observe these changes. If there's any issue with this process or the green light is not stable, please let me know, and we'll troubleshoot those problems. Work on the registration now and please provide an update when that's completed. The current state is Registration. The suggested actions are [{'name': 'Register Modem', 'nextState': 'Desired'}].
