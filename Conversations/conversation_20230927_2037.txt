Assistant's response: Alright, I see that you are currently in the 'Initial' state where your modem is showing a blinking red light and there is no Internet connection. Don't worry, I am here to guide you step-by-step to achieve a stable Internet connection by taking your modem to the 'Desired' state. 

So, let's get started.

1. From the 'Initial' state, the first action you should take is to 'Power On' the modem. When you do this, your modem will enter the 'PoweringOn' state. 

How to do it:
You can usually find the power button at the back of the modem. Press it and watch for the lights on your modem to start flashing in sequence. This indicates that the modem is successfully powering on.

2. After powering on, the next action is 'Power On Complete', which means you wait for the modem to completely power on. This will take your modem from the 'PoweringOn' to 'Registration' state.

How to do it:
Once the modem is powered on completely, the lights will stop flashing in sequence and you'll likely see a solid light (usually green or blue). 

3. In the 'Registration' state, the next step you should take is to 'Register Modem'. 

How to do it:
This process can differ depending on your Internet Service Provider (ISP). Generally, this involves using a connected device to navigate to a specific website provided by your ISP where you can register your modem. If you are unsure about this process, it would be best to contact your ISP for detailed instructions.

4. Performing the 'Register Modem' action will bring your modem to the 'Desired' state where you should have a solid green light and a stable Internet connection.  

Let's begin with these steps. Keep me posted after each step so I can guide you further if needed.

User's response: Firstly, I understand that your current state is 'Initial', which is depicted by a blinking red light on your modem. Because of this, you do not currently have an Internet connection.

Based on the state machine given to us, the next action for you to perform is 'Power On'. To do this, you will need to turn on the power to your modem.

The next state after performing this action would be 'PoweringOn'. In this state, you would notice your modem flashing lights in sequence. This action does not immediately resolve the issue of No Internet Connection.

Once you have powered on your modem, please confirm to me that the action 'Power On Complete' has been executed. You should reach the state 'Registration'. In this state, you will notice a solid green light on your Modem. However, please note your internet might still not be working.

In this 'Registration' state, your next action is to 'Register Modem'. This is to ensure that your modem is correctly connected with your Internet Service Provider.

On successful 'Register Modem' execution, your next state should be 'Desired'. At this state, you will see a solid green light on your Modem, indicating a Stable Internet connection.

If you follow these steps correctly, you should be able to reach the 'Desired' state and have your internet connection up and running.

Remember, after each action, please report back the state to which you have transitioned to, and confirm before performing the next action.

Now, please proceed with the action 'Power On' and let me know once the lights on your modem have started flashing in sequence, indicating the state 'PoweringOn'. I'll guide you from there based on your progress report. Be patient and methodical. Let's get that internet up and running.
Assistant's response: Great, you've powered on your modem and are now in the 'PoweringOn' state. The next action you need to take is to confirm 'Power On Complete'. This will transition you to the next state, 'Registration'.

In the 'Registration' state, you will notice a solid green light on your modem. However, you still might not have an Internet connection at this point. 

Once you've confirmed that 'Power On Complete' has been performed and are now seeing a solid green light on your modem, please perform the action 'Register Modem'.

After successfully registering your modem, you will reach the 'Desired' state, where you should have a stable Internet connection indicated by a solid green light on your modem. 

Please perform these steps and report back to me once you're seeing a stable, solid green light on your modem. This will indicate that you're in the 'Desired' state and we can confirm that your Internet issue has been resolved.
