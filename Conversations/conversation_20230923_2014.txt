Assistant's response: Alright, based on the state machine provided, it seems like your router is currently in the 'Initial' state, meaning there is a blinking red light on it indicating no internet connection. Your goal is to reach the 'Desired' state where you see a solid green light, indicating stable internet connection. 

Here are step-by-step instructions:

1. From the 'Initial' state, perform a 'Power On' action. In this state, typically, the power button should be pressed down until the lights start flashing in a sequence. Let me know once you've done this. We're trying to move to the 'PoweringOn' state.
   
2. After performing the 'Power On' action, your router should move into the 'PoweringOn' state whereupon you'll see the lights flashing in a sequence. It also means the router is lacking internet connection. Next, you have to wait until it completes powering on. The router will automatically perform the 'Power On Complete' action, after which you should be in the 'Registration' state. Please observe this transition and inform me when it has happened.
   
3. Once in the 'Registration' state, you should see a solid green light, meaning the router is ready to be registered but currently unable to connect to the internet. Here, you need to take an action called 'Register Modem'. This might involve introducing your router's MAC address to your Internet Service Provider so they can identify it and add it to their network. Once you've done this let me know.
   
4. Upon completing the 'Register Modem' action, the modem should automatically transition to the 'Desired' state. If the transition occurs correctly, you should see a solid green light indicating a stable internet connection.

So, could you now please start with the first step, power on your router and let me know when the lights start flashing in sequence? I will guide you through the next steps as we progress.

User's response: Plan of action:
1. We are currently in the 'Initial' state where your modem shows a blinking red light and you can't connect to the Internet. The action we can take from this state is 'Power On'.

Action item 1: Please power up your modem.

Now I expect the modem to start generating different light signals, which corresponds to state 'PoweringOn'.

2. Once in 'PoweringOn' state, your modem will start flashing lights in a sequence but unfortunately, you still won't have Internet access. You will then need to wait till the 'Power On' process is complete.

Action item 2: Please confirm if the 'Power On' process is complete.

3. As soon as you successfully complete the power up sequence, the modem will enter the 'Registration' state, and you should observe a solid green light. But you will still lack an Internet connection. From this state, you can now 'Register Modem' to reach our 'desired' state.

Action item 3: Please register your modem. 

4. If you've executed 'Register Modem' action successfully, your modem should now enter 'Desired' state, still showing a solid green light. But this time, you should have a stable Internet connection.

Action item 4: Please check if you now have a stable Internet connection, which is the final stage.

Again, during each step, please report back to me so that we can confirm we are progressing correctly. And remember, if we successfully reach the 'desired' state, your issues should be resolved. You can then say, "I have reached the desired state."
