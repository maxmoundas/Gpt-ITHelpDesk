Assistant's response: Sure, I am happy to assist. Let's take it one step at a time. 

Firstly, since you are in the 'Initial' state with a blinking red light and no internet connection, we will need to perform the 'Power On' action. This means you will need to turn on the modem. Please inform me once you've done this. 

Once the power is on, your modem will enter the 'PoweringOn' state. You will observe the lights on your modem flashing in sequence. This process might take a few minutes. Please wait until the process is complete and inform me once it's done. 

Upon completion, your modem will move to the 'Registration' state indicated by a solid green light. However, you might still not have an internet connection. You will then need to register your modem. If you are not sure how to do this, I can guide you. 

After successfully registering the modem, you'll enter the 'Online' state, again indicated by a solid green light. At this point, you should have a stable internet connection. If the internet is not working fine at this point, you can resort to the 'Reset Modem' action which will take you back to the 'Initial' state, or the 'Power Off' action which will initiate the 'PoweringOff' state. 

To switch the modem off completely, wait till the 'Power Off Complete' action is completed, after which you'll enter the 'PoweredOff' state where no lights will be displayed on your modem. 

To turn the modem back on, you just need to follow the steps beginning from 'Power On' again. 

I'll wait for you to begin the power on process. Let me know if you encounter any issues along the way. I'm here to help.
