Assistant's response: As an IT help desk, I must help the user follow through the transitions of the state machine to reach the 'Desired' state from the 'Initial' state. Currently, the user's modem is in the 'Initial' state, as indicated by a blinking red light, and without an Internet connection.

Here is the step-by-step guidance I am going to give the user:

1. First, I will tell the user to 'Power On' the modem, as dictated by the action under the 'Initial' state. This action will make the modem enter the 'PoweringOn' state, where the lights flash in sequence, but the Internet connection will still be unavailable.

2. After the power on is complete, the user must inform me. The modem will now be in the 'PoweringOn' state. The next action that the user should take is 'Power On Complete'. This action will move the modem to the 'Registration' state, where the modem will show a solid green light but still not provide an Internet connection.

3. Once the 'Registration' state is reached, the user should 'Register Modem'. This action will help the modem transition into the 'Desired' state. At this point, a solid green light will still be visible on the modem, but now the Internet connection will be stable.

During this process, it's important for the user to confirm the completion of each action and the status of the lights on the modem. These steps should help the user reach the 'Desired' state, where the internet connection is stable. If anything unusual occurs, I will reassess the situation based on the 'states' available and the 'actions' possible in each state.

Finally, it is critical to establish that the 'Desired' state has been reached, and the user has a stable Internet connection. That's when I know I have successfully guided the user through the state machine to resolve the issue.
