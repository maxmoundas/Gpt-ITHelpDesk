As the state machine got more complex, the node and edge count got larger, and it took more interactions to complete the conversation.
Also, the graph density decreased, the cyclomatic complexity fluctuated, and the average degree decreased then increased.
Next, the average path length and average diameter increased.
Finally, the conversation took more time to complete.
This is all in line with what I expected, except for the cyclomatic complexity and average degree fluctuation.
