Assistant's response: As an IT Help Desk, I can provide your assistance based on your modem's state machine you provided. 

The current state of your modem is 'Initial,' which indicates a 'blink red light' with 'No internet connection.' We need to reach 'Desired' state for a stable internet connection. 

Here's how we are going to handle this:

1. **Power on** your modem. This will bring your modem to the 'PoweringOn' state.
2. After successfully powering on, you should see your modem lights flashing in sequence. That means your modem is ready for the next step.
3. The next step is to **complete the power on** phase. This will bring us to the 'Registration' state.
4. In the 'Registration' state, you will see a 'solid green light,' but it's normal not to have an internet connection yet.
5. Now, we need to **register your modem**. After this, we will reach the 'Desired' state.
6. Once in the 'Desired' state, you will again see a solid green light, but now, you should have a stable internet connection.

Don't hesitate to reset your modem or power it off if you encounter any issues during these steps. Just follow the steps provided again. 

Please keep me updated with the progress. I will guide you throughout the process.
User's response: As your IT Help Desk, I will guide you to achieve the 'Desired' state, which indicates a stable internet connection. Currently, the modem is in the 'Initial' state which is described as 'Blinking red light' showing a loss of Internet connection. Let's start with the necessary actions to get the connection back.

1. The first step is 'Power On'. You must switch on the modem and wait for some time. The modem's power light will transition from 'Blinking red light' and start flashing lights in a sequence in the 'PoweringOn' state. Do let me know when this happens.

After ensuring that you have followed this step, I'll further guide you on the next steps based on your feedback.

2. Once the modem has powered on completely, it will reach the 'Registration' state, which is indicated by a 'Solid green light'. Please confirm when the modem's light turns steady green.

Upon receiving your progress, we will move forward with the next steps.

3. You're on the 'Registration' state now, Your next step is to 'Register Modem' if not done automatically, may have to log in to the modem's admin page and register it through there. After successful registration, it's now moving into 'Desired' state with the same 'Solid green light'. 

After you have confirmed the green light has remained steady, we have effectively fixed the problem, and you have a stable Internet connection.

Please take the steps as directed and keep me updated with the progress. I'm here to help you.
Assistant's response: As your IT Help Desk, I'm here to assist you in moving from the 'Initial' state to the 'Desired' state, leading to a stable internet connection. Here are the steps we need to follow:

1. **Initial state**: Currently, your modem is in this state, indicated by a blinking red light, which means that you don't have an internet connection.

   Action - Power on the modem. Please ensure that the modem is plugged in and turned on.

2. **Powering On state**: After powering on, the modem will start flashing lights in sequence, but you still won't have internet.

   Action - You just need to wait until the power-on process is complete. Nothing needs to be done from your end at this moment. Please let me know when the modem stops flashing lights and instead has a solid green light. 

3. **Registration state**: The modem will move to this state once it is successfully powered on, indicated by a solid green light. However, at this point, the Modem is not yet registered, hence there would again be no internet connectivity.

   Action - You need to register the modem. Depending on the model, the registration process can vary. Usually, this process involves logging into the modem software via a connected device and entering the necessary information. Please let me know when you've successfully registered the modem, as your internet should be active by then. 

4. **Desired state**: Once the modem is registered, it will finally move to the desired state. This again will be indicated by a solid green light, but at this point you should have a stable internet connection.

   Note - In the desired state, you can either reset the modem which will take it back to the 'Initial' State, or power off the modem which will take it to 'PoweringOff' state. We don't need to perform either of these actions right now.

Please perform these steps in order and update me with the progress so I can guide you to the next step accordingly.
